Learning to train RL-agents.

The plan is to experiment with openai gym, implement some calassic algorithms, try some of my own and some state of the art.

---

TODO:

- look through my current silly agent
- think how to improve the code so that I can:
  - add new kinds of agents easily
  - compare different agents
- improve the code
- add some other agents and compare with silly one
- think of some ways of visualizing the insides of my current agents so that you can think of ways of improving them easier
...
- think of ways to parallel training different agents for comparisons (use all 4 threads)

DONE:
- check silly agent on some other env then CartPole
